### 1.1.3 Fingerprint Features
*Ridges* - where the skin has a higher profile than its surroundings **(BLACK)** \
*Valleys* - where the skin has a lower profile than its surroundings **(WHITE)** \
*Directional field* (DF) - local orientation of the ridge-valley structures **(VECTOR FIELD)** \
*The singular points* (SPs) - discontinuities in the directional field **(CORE, DELTA)** \
*Minutiae* - details of the ridge-valley structures **(RIDGE ENDINGS, BIFURCATIONS)** \
*Directional field* is used for **enhancement** of the fingerprint \
*Directional field* + *The singular points* is used for **classification** \
*Minutiae* is used for **matching** \

### Steps

#### 1. Feature Extraction
1. *Directional field* estimation
2. *Singular point* Extraction

3. Segmentation of fingerprint
4. *Minutiae* Extraction

#### 2. Matching

#### 3. Database Search
